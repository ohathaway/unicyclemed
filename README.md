# Unicycle Serverless MSP App Functions

This is a start to collecting PowerShell scripts and Azure templates for Unicycle to use through Azure Lighthouse.

By using the Serverless Framework, these tools can be managed DevOps-style through the git repo and Azure cloud resources.

Who knows, perhaps we'll even build some web front-end stuff for it.
